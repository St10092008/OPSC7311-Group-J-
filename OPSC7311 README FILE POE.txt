IN THIS README FILE WE'LL BE EXPPLAINING THE FEATURES THAT WE ADDED TO OUR TIMESYNC MOBILE APPLICATION


FEATURES:

COST AND PROFIT: The cost and profit feature is a feature that we added to our TimeSync mobile application.
The android application must be able to calculate the project costs as the user must state how much money does it costs to
 proceed with the project. The application must also be able to subtract the total amount of expenses from the overall 
budget which the user must state to determine whether the project will end up in a profit or loss

POINT REWARD SYSTEM : This feature lets the user track their progress regarding a project using a point system.
 Once a project is completed, the user will gain a point. If the user accumulates a lot of points, then the user can 
reward themselves with whatever the user wants.
